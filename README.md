# mclang (macro C lang)

This is a programming language based on the C language macro.
Based on the C language, the macro function is used to redefine
some keywords and syntax. This is not like the interpreter, 
it will be expanded into C language code during the C macro 
expansion stage, and then compiled into assembly and machine code,
so its execution efficiency is the same as C language. In other words, just changed the C language, it still looks very cool!

Everyting in the mclang.h, the only thing you need to do is to #include"mclang.h", then you can use it!
